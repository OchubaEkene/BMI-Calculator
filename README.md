BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It's a measure used to assess if a person has a healthy weight for their height.
It's calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. 

BMI is commonly used as a screening tool to identify potential weight problems in adults. 
However, it doesn't directly measure body fat and doesn't account for factors like muscle mass, bone density, and overall body composition,
so it's not always a perfect indicator of health.
